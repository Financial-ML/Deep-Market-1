# Deep-Market-1

### Overview

In Deep Market-1 we develop deep learning Algorithm for time series prediction specifically for finance data and apply it in forex Market.

# Analyzer Components

* [Backtest](#Backtest)

* [Feature](#Feature)

* [MLT](#MLT)

* [Data](#Data)


## Backtest

in Backtest we test the model performance and measure the profit of the model in a specific period.

   
## Feature

In Feature we calculate the Feature based on this research [(here)](http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2011/Penang/ACRE/ACRE-05.pdf).


## MLP
Is a Deep Learning algorithm that we used to implement on our project to learn more a about it [(here)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron).


## Data

In Data we extract the necessary data to feed it into the algorithm.
